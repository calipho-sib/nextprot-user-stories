# For developers

Developers uses an IDE to code such as Eclipse or Intellij. Both provides plugins for cucumber/gherkin.

# For features writers (Monique, Amos...)

We need a simpler, generic editor with support for cucumber. This editor should have:

1. syntax highlighting for gherkin
2. auto-completion on feature steps

[Brackets.io](http://brackets.io/) and [Visual-studio-code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?utm_expid=101350005-28.R1T8FshdTBWEfZjY0s7XKQ.0&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.ch%2F)
actually only support syntax highlighting but no auto-completion.

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is a text editor developed by github comes with both needed capabilities :)

After installing Atom, install the following packages:

- package 'cucumber'
- package 'cucumber-autocomplete'
