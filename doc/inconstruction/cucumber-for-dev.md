Of User stories, features and cucumbers
---------------------------------------

# What we have in nextprot and what we need

Unit testing: test that a class is doing what it is supposed to do

Continuous Integration (jenkins): push to github, build, run unit tests, deploy, sonar:
Each time we modify our code, unit tests run to check our app is not broken then deploy to miniwatt.

... but we do not know if the features are not broken...

high-level acceptance test

# Requirement and user story (https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories)

A requirement is a specific thing your system has to do to work correctly.
Use case driven development.

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:

As a <type of user>, I want <some goal> so that <some reason>.

User stories are often written on index cards or sticky notes and arranged on walls or drawers :)

It should be intelligible to both dev and customer that should understand what a user story exactly means.

ex:

1. As       : As a end user of www.nextprot.org
2. Intention: I want to save the result of my previous search
3. Reason   : so that I can access to results in my private space

# Who writes user stories?

Anyone can write user stories. It's the product owner's responsibility to make sure a product backlog of agile user stories exists, but that doesnâ€™t mean that the product owner is the one who writes them. Over the course of a good agile project, you should expect to have user story examples written by each team member.
Also, note that who writes a user story is far less important than who is involved in the discussions of it.

# Automate features test

What if we can:

1. formalize our features ()
2. test them
3. and integrate those tests in our CI platform

Behaviour Driver Development

# Cucumber

https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/test-automation-jenkins-integration-cucumber-abhimatt-umamaheswara

Cucumber is a tool which built on the concept of BDD framework, where acceptance tests are written in behavior-driven development (BDD) style, jenkins provides a usefull plug-in to integrate with cucumber(Cucumber plug-in) for the excution of the tests.

# Setup jenkins to execute features

TODO

# Demos on specific package

TODO

# Improvement/suggestions

In order to not repeat ourself, I would like the user-story writter to write
the correct step sentence based on what already exists !

Each steps should probably be grouped in different categories:

- web base steps (navigate to url, click on buttonm, ...)
- registering to nextprot
- ...

The graal could be completion feat helping writting those steps like intellij

## Development cycle and coordination between feature writers and java coders (TODO, TOTHINK)

There is a list of step definitions already mapping java code in this repository.
They are accessible through auto-completion when writing future `scenario`.

When new steps are created, it is not executable by `cucumber` and the java logic will have to be written by a developer.
